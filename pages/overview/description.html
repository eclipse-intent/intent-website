<h3>Intent - tooling for writing useful and synchronized documentation</h3>

<p>
	<a href="http://wiki.eclipse.org/Intent"> Intent</a> is a tool allowing developers to easily write a documentation up-to-date with any development artifact (models, code, environment...). 
	<br/><br/>
	The documentation, integrated with other Eclipse tools, then becomes truly useful and is no longer a burden that developer have to carry to please their customers or their project manager.
	<br/><br/>
	Based on Donald Knuth's <a href="http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~uno/lp.html">Literate Programming</a> concepts and allowing collaborative work around design tasks, Intent will try to reconcile developers with Documentation.

</p>

<p>
		Intent will be released under the <a href="http://wiki.eclipse.org/Mylyn"> Mylyn </a> top-level project, and is planned to be fully integrated with Mylyn tools.
		<br/><br/>
		 This project was just provisioned. You can see the proposal 
		<a href="/proposals/mylyn.docs.intent">here</a>, and get additional informations on the <a href="http://wiki.eclipse.org/Intent"> Intent's Wiki</a>.
