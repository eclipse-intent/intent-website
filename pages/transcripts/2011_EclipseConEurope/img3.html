<p><p style="direction:ltr;">First of all, let us ask a simple question&nbsp;: why do we write doc&nbsp;? </p>
<p style="direction:ltr;"></p>
<p style="direction:ltr;">Well it's quite simple&nbsp;: we write doc to communicate efficiently with our team and to remember the decisions we made.</p>
<p style="direction:ltr;"></p>
<p style="direction:ltr;">When we write a documentation, more than the code itself we would like our reader to understand the spirit behind it : 
what main concerns and requirements made us choose the current architecture ?</p>
<p style="direction:ltr;"></p>
<p style="direction:ltr;"> I should not have to stress out how important it is that everyone understand these Intents behind softwares : </p>
<p style="direction:ltr;">- first of all, when your team grows up, newcomers should quickly understand your software architecture and how to 
properly extend it, to be able to maintain and improve your software (which is basically what they are paid for). 
You don't have the time to explain all these choices by yourself, so documentation is a perfect way to do it.<br/>- What is more, I challenge you to explain clearly the design choices you made on a project six months ago ;
 I am sure that you will forget an important concern.</p>
<p style="direction:ltr;"></p>
<p style="direction:ltr;">To capture such intents, we can use many kind of doc format&nbsp;: </p>
<p style="direction:ltr;">- Javadoc is great to explain what a Package / Class / method is about.<br/>
However, its <b>scope is too narrow</b> to present high-level considerations&nbsp;: how would I explain the design choices I made or a functional requirement when focusing on a Java Class ? I see the tree, but where is the forest&nbsp;?</p>
<p style="direction:ltr;">- Models are great to capture constraints and formalize design.<br/>But we have the same issue here: with a formal structure, 
you cannot properly split your explanations across concerns or functional requirements. </p>
<p style="direction:ltr;"></p>
<p style="direction:ltr;">That is why what I call <b>high-level documentation</b> (such as textile files, Latex or Open Office documents) is a much better fit for this task&nbsp;: </p>
<p style="direction:ltr;"> its structure allows to present each concern in one specific chapter or section. In result, a reader will be able to discover the software step by step, with a bird-eye view of each main requirements and design decision. </p>
